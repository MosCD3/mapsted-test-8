Used MVC styl based architecture although not fully implimenteed duo to project size
Used dependency injection in most cases to improve scalability and testability 
Used Singleton in som cases where mocked data not that important
Used generic collectionview page that allowsscaling the app with some more code ree-factoring

If time is available more re-factoring may enhance the project
More to discuss with technical team
